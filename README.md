</h1>

I'm Wincohax, an average teenager who is trying his best to not end up on a couch.

I started using computers since I was very young and I always liked the idea of customize my system and learn how things work.

_Most of my childhood I spent it on my PC playing w/ VMS using VirtualBox Or VMWARE._

Nowadays I switched to **Linux** for a more pleasent exprience and **_I don't regert it._** Now I'm trying to get into Web or Software development.

# Things that I'm good at

- Tech Support (Fr ðŸ’€).

- Minecraft.

- English (people say I speak english better than my native language ðŸª¦).

- osu! (ig).

- Procastinating (This MD is a pretty good example).

- Video Editing (Kdenlive, Davinci Resolve).

# Things That I would love to learn (Or I'm Learing)

- Bash

- C

- C# (**_Dropped_**, I'll take it over at some point)

- CSS (On it)

- GTK

- HTML (On it)

- JS (On it)

- Kotlin (On it _kinda_)

# What's Next?

I'm in the proccess of finishing high school and also on the way to get my english certification, my idea is go to college or get a way of getting some kind of income.

I would like to create some project that can be helpful for people, I also love the idea of Open Source so I'll mostly publish every software that I will make here on github.

I'm not that into commercial profit but I'm sure I'll get over it (?.
