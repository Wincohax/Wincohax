I'm Wincohax, an average teenager who is trying his best to not end up on a couch.

I started using computers when I was very young and always liked the idea of customizing my system and learning how things work.

_I spent Most of my childhood on my PC playing w/ VMS using VirtualBox Or VMWARE._

Nowadays I switched to **Linux** for a more pleasant experience and **_I don't regret it._** Now I'm trying to get into Low Level Software development.

# Things that I'm good at

- osu!

- Troubleshooting 

- Video Editing (Kdenlive, Davinci Resolve).

# Things That I would love to learn (Or I'm Learning)

- Bash

- C (On it)

- C++ (On it)

- Java

- Rust

- GTK 

- Kotlin (**_Dropped_**)

# What's Next?

Get into Reverse Engineering.

# Where am I?
