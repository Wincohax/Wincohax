I'm Wincohax, an average teenager who is trying his best to not end up on a couch.

I started using computers when I was very young and always liked the idea of customizing my system and learning how things work.

_I spent Most of my childhood on my PC playing w/ VMS using VirtualBox Or VMWARE._

Nowadays I switched to **Linux** for a more pleasant experience and **_I don't regret it._** Now I'm trying to get into Low Level Software development.
