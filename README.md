</h1>

I'm Wincohax, an average teenager who is trying his best to not end up on a couch.

I started using computers when I was very young and I always liked the idea of customizing my system and learning how things work.

_I spent Most of my childhood on my PC playing w/ VMS using VirtualBox Or VMWARE._

Nowadays I switched to **Linux** for a more pleasant exprience and **_I don't regret it._** Now I'm trying to get into Web or Software development.

# Things that I'm good at

- Tech Support (Fr 💀).

- Minecraft.

- English (people say I speak english better than my native language 🪦).

- osu! (ig).

- Procrastinating (This MD is a pretty good example).

- Video Editing (Kdenlive, Davinci Resolve).

# Things That I would love to learn (Or I'm Learning)

- Bash

- C

- C# (**_Dropped_**, I'll take it over at some point)

- CSS (On it)

- GTK

- HTML (On it)

- JS (On it)

- Kotlin (On it _kinda_)

# What's Next?

I'm in the process of finishing high school and also on the way to getting my english certification, my idea is to go to college or get a way of getting some kind of income.

I would like to create some projects that can be helpful for people, I also love the idea of Open Source so I'll mostly publish every software that I will make here on Github.

I'm not that into commercial profit but I'm sure I'll get over it (?.
